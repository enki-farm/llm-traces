# Contributing to LLM Traces

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.6 (required for `--experimental-strip-types`)
- npm >= 10
- Docker and Docker Compose v2.17+ (for local development stack)

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enki-farm/llm-traces.git
cd llm-traces
npm install
```

## Building

```bash
# Standalone build (recommended for contributors)
npm run build:standalone

# Watch mode (requires Grafana monorepo at ../grafana)
npm run dev:host
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# All unit tests
npm test

# Lint and typecheck
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-change`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all checks pass: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Open a pull request

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include tests for new logic (unit tests in `tests/`)
- Ensure the pre-commit hook passes (typecheck + lint + unit tests)
- Update the CHANGELOG if applicable

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- ESLint enforces bug-catching rules (react-hooks exhaustive-deps, no-unreachable, etc.)
- No Prettier — formatting is not enforced beyond ESLint rules
